# Koala Holla Sequelize
Koalla Holla is an web application that inputs new Koallas, let's us know if they are ready for transfer, and removes them when desired.

Our old client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA), has jumped on the bandwagon and is asking for an updated web application using React.

This time around, they care very much about quality. They've read about things like "unit testing" and "small, reusable components" and are very much looking forward to having those things in their version 2.0.
